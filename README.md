# tic-tac-toe
In this project, I designed and developed an interactive Tic-Tac- Toe game using JavaFX, and incorporated essential Data Structures 
and Algorithms (DSA) skills, particularly matrices, tobuild the game's logic and ensure efficient execution.

The Tic- Tac-Toe game provides an engaging and intuitive user interfacethrough JavaFX, allowing players to compete against each other
on a 3x3 grid. 
Leveraging DSA knowledge of matrices, I implemented the underlying game logic, enabling seamless tracking of moves, determining 
winning conditions, and detecting draws.
